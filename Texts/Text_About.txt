About

So this is Marcel. A 90's born in Barcelona, grown by the Mediterranean.
Grew up as a child surrounded by cardboard and paint, by pencils and tape. As an adult, that hasn't changed.

Always inspired by the world around, by its places and its people, and transforming it into new creations, into design, with the mindset of hopefully being able to inspire others and thus give back as much as received.

With experience in the furniture industry, mainly seating, having developed products both for home and contract sectors and lastly having worked as a Product Designer at Figueras Seating.

Interested in the user experience in product design, the interaction between the user and the designed product, and the meaning of materiality within this relationship.
